    # Storybook for Supercode Plugin 

    Supercode uses storybook for testing and development of the plugin. You can find all the stories in the left side panel.
    
    ## Setting up Development

    To set up development for the Supercode plugin, follow these steps:

    1. Clone your fork of the Supercode repository from GitHub:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/prathamVaidya/supercode-tinymce-plugin.git
    ```

    2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies

    ```bash
    yarn
    ```

    3. Start the storybook development server:

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

    The main `plugin.js` file is inside `src` folder. Edit the `plugin.js` and use the storybook to test how changes are taking effect.
